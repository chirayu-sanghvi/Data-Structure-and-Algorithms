Identification: 
If you find these twqo conditions that most propably this question belongs to heap: 
1) K
2) Smallest / Largest

if k + smallest = Max heap 
if k + largest = Min heap

Heap coverts the time complexity to sort from nlogn to nlogk , given we need k elements
(Hence heap is mostly used in the questions related to sorting and arranging)

The height of a complete binary tree is minimum always log(n)

### Why we use heapify method to build heap (max/min) ? 
Because the usual method will take O(nlogn) time but heapify method will only take O(n) time.
